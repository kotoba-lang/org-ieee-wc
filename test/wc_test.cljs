;; This does not assert that the guest COMPILES. It compiles it, packages it
;; into a standalone binary, runs that binary, and compares its bytes and its
;; exit status against /bin/cat -- because `:ok true` from a compiler means
;; the artifact was built, not that it is right, and this repository's whole
;; claim is about what the artifact does.
;;
;; Every case is passed as an ARGUMENT VECTOR, never through a shell. zsh does
;; not word-split an unquoted variable, so `cmd $args` hands the whole string
;; over as ONE argument -- which silently turns a multi-argument test into a
;; single-argument one and makes the join logic and `-n` look tested when they
;; are not. Measured 2026-09-09: exactly that mistake made `-n hi` and
;; `a b c d e` pass before either was implemented or exercised.
